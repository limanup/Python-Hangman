# Hangman
Hangman (game) - guess the secret word!

Starts up an interactive game of Hangman.
    
    * At the start of the game, you will know how many 
      letters the secret word contains and how many guesses you start with.
      
    * You will start with 6 guesses and 3 warnings,
    
    * If you guessed a letter right, you do not lose guess in that round.
    
    * Before each round, the program will display to you how many guesses you have left 
      and the letters that you have not yet guessed are displayed as '_ '.
    
    * Please enter one character per round. If the guess entered is not a letter or 
      more than one letter, you will lose 1 warning.
      If you have already lost all your warnings, you will lose 1 guess.
      
    * You will receive feedback immediately after each guess 
      about whether the guess appears in the secret word.

    * After each guess, partially guessed word will be displayed.
      
    * You can use the symbol * as a guess to get hints. If you enter * ,
      all words in pool that matches the current guessed word will be shown to you.
